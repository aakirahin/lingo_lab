# Lingo Lab

A language learning app, created with React, to test your pronunciation skills.

You will be asked to choose the language that you are trying to learning; this will be assigned to the speech recognition. The selected number of questions will be randomly picked and you will begin the quiz. 

By speaking into your microphone, it will transcribe what you've said and compare its likeness to the actual translated phrase. This app uses the Google Translate API (found here https://rapidapi.com/googlecloud/api/google-translate1) to detect the correctness of spoken phrases.

At the end of the quiz, it will show you all the questions you got correct and incorrect.
